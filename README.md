# hdcms

This library is available on pypi [here](https://pypi.org/project/hdcms/). Install using `pip install hdcms`.

A very simple example:

```python
import hdcms as hdc

hdc.generate_examples(visualize=True)
gaussian_sum_stat = hdc.regex2stats1d(r"gaus_\d+.txt")
laplacian_sum_stat = hdc.regex2stats1d(r"laplace_\d+\.txt")

print(hdc.compare(gaussian_sum_stat, laplacian_sum_stat))
hdc.write_image(gaussian_sum_stat, "tmp.png")
```

This library is built on top of the [`hdcms-bindings` package](https://pypi.org/project/hdcms-bindings/), which exposes python bindings to a C library. That bindings package contains only a few functions and lacks a nice user experience. But, if you are only interested in that, check it out.

For more documentation: see [`examples/` directory](https://github.com/jasoneveleth/hdcms-python/tree/main/examples).

## Dependencies

`numpy` is a necessary dependency for every function. 

`matplotlib` and scipy are needed for `generate_example()`, which will generate a random synthetic data set.
